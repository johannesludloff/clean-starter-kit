The simplest way to get receipts into Lujo: forward them to your unique inbox email address.

## Get your inbox email

1. Go to [Inbox](https://app.lujo.app/inbox)
2. Click **Settings** or the gear icon
3. Copy your unique inbox email address

It looks like: `inbox-abc123@lujo.app`

## Forward receipts

When you receive a receipt:

1. Forward the email to your inbox address
2. Lujo extracts the receipt automatically
3. AI matches it to your transactions

That's it. No apps to open, no files to upload.

## Set up automatic forwarding

### Gmail

1. Open Gmail Settings → Forwarding
2. Add your Lujo inbox address
3. Create a filter to auto-forward receipts

### Outlook

1. Open Settings → Mail → Forwarding
2. Enable forwarding to your Lujo inbox
3. Or use rules to forward specific emails

### Other email providers

Most email providers support forwarding rules. Search for "auto forward" in your email settings.

## What gets extracted

From forwarded emails, Lujo extracts:

- PDF attachments
- Image attachments (receipts, photos)
- Embedded receipt images

Plain text emails without attachments are processed but may have limited data.

## Tips

- Forward receipts the same day for best matching
- Include the original email (not just attachments) for more context
- Works great alongside connected email for maximum capture
