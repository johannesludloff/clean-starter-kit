## Managing integrations

### View connected apps

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.lujo.app/apps)
2. See all connected integrations
3. Check connection status

### Disconnect an app

1. Go to [Apps](https://app.lujo.app/apps)
2. Find the integration
3. Click **Disconnect**

Disconnecting removes the connection but doesn't delete historical data.

### Reconnect an app

Some integrations need periodic re-authentication:

1. You'll see a notification when reconnection is needed
2. Go to [Apps](https://app.lujo.app/apps)
3. Click **Reconnect** and re-authorize

## Data and privacy

- **Read-only where possible**: Email integrations only read—never send
- **Minimal permissions**: We request only what's needed
- **Secure connections**: All integrations use OAuth or encrypted credentials
- **You control access**: Disconnect anytime

## Coming soon

We're always adding new integrations. Have a request? Let us know at [support@lujo.app](mailto:support@lujo.app).
